## Tech stack

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- Mantine UI
- Tanstack Router
- MDX

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Any node.js-compatible package manager (I will use [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/))

## Running locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To run this app in production mode you need to build it first:

```bash
bun run build
```

Now you can either preview it:

```bash
bun run preview
```

Or deploy it to a hosting.

## Deploying
